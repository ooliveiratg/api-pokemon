my first API consumption, I made the html and css in a simple way, 
because my focus was to learn how to consume an API using javaScript, without seeing 
any kind of tutorial, but rather learning by researching on several websites to get an idea 
of ​​what I had to do, I left some notes so I wouldn't forget the tags, thank you for your attention :)
